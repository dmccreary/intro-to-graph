Students learn why traditional relational databases struggle with modern, relationship-heavy data and how Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases treat relationships as first-class citizens with relationaship types, attributes, directionality, and semantics.</p> <p>We begin by contrasting the architectural foundations of RDBMS vs. NoSQL systems, explore the design motivations behind graph data models, and introduce the formal elements of LPGs: nodes, edges, properties, labels, and schema options. Students then gain hands-on experience modeling and querying real-world graphs using languages such as openCypher, or GSQL (depending on instructor preference).</p> <p>The course emphasizes building real applications: social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection pipelines, supply-chain models, knowledge graphs, bill-of-materials (BOM), and healthcare data modeling. Students practice evaluating when to choose graph data models, how to optimize them, how to measure performance, and how to design graph schemas aligned with real business domains.</p> <p>The capstone project involves building an end-to-end graph application using an LPG graph database.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#sample-outline-14-weeks","title":"Sample Outline (14 Weeks)","text":""},{"location":"course-description/#week-1-introduction-to-graph-thinking","title":"Week 1 \u2013 Introduction to Graph Thinking","text":"<ul> <li>Why data modeling matters in our AI-driven world</li> <li>The importance of world-models</li> <li>Knowledge representation strategy</li> <li>Six major representations of data</li> <li>RDBMS vs. OLAP vs. NoSQL</li> <li>When graphs outperform tables</li> <li>Edges are a first class citizen</li> <li>LPG: The most maintainable information model</li> <li>Case Study: Neo4j</li> <li>Timeline of Graph Database</li> </ul>"},{"location":"course-description/#week-2-nosql-and-the-rise-of-graphs","title":"Week 2 \u2013 NoSQL and the Rise of Graphs","text":"<ul> <li>Key-value, document, wide-column, and graph stores</li> <li>Tradeoff analysis (model precision, flexibility, scaling)</li> <li>Representations of knowledge</li> <li>The Knowledge Triangle</li> <li>Single server graphs</li> <li>Distributed graphs</li> <li>Case Study: TigerGraph</li> </ul>"},{"location":"course-description/#week-3-labeled-property-graph-lpg-information-model","title":"Week 3 \u2013 Labeled Property Graph (LPG) Information Model","text":"<ul> <li>Nodes, edges, labels, properties</li> <li>Representing metadata</li> <li>Open vs. Closed World Models</li> <li>Schema-optional vs. schema-enforced modeling</li> <li>Tools to view graph data models</li> <li>Adding rules to graphs</li> <li>Validating documents</li> <li>Validating graphs</li> </ul>"},{"location":"course-description/#week-4-query-languages-for-graphs","title":"Week 4 \u2013 Query Languages for Graphs","text":"<ul> <li>openCypher</li> <li>GSQL -
