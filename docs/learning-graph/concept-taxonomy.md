## Taxonomy Design Principles

1. **Pedagogical Organization:** Categories follow a logical learning progression from foundations to applications
2. **Even Distribution:** Each category targets 12-20 concepts to avoid over-representation
3. **Clear Boundaries:** Each concept has a clear primary category
4. **Progressive Complexity:** Foundation → Core → Advanced → Applications
5. **Industry Relevance:** Application categories reflect real-world use cases
