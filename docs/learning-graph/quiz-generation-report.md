## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

### Aggregate Distribution Across All Chapters (120 questions)

| Cognitive Level | Target % | Actual Count | Actual % | Deviation | Status |
|-----------------|----------|--------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Remember | 25% | 24 | 20% | -5% | ✅ Acceptable |
| Understand | 30% | 42 | 35% | +5% | ✅ Good |
| Apply | 25% | 28 | 23% | -2% | ✅ Good |
| Analyze | 20% | 26 | 22% | +2% | ✅ Good |
| Evaluate | 0% | 0 | 0% | 0% | ✅ N/A |
| Create | 0% | 0 | 0% | 0% | ✅ N/A |

**Bloom's Distribution Score:** 90/100 (Excellent)

**Analysis:** Distribution shows excellent balance with slight emphasis on Understanding (35% vs target 30%), which is appropriate for a conceptual course where understanding graph patterns and relationships is foundational. The Apply and Analyze levels combine for 45% of questions, demonstrating strong emphasis on practical application and critical thinking.

### Distribution by Chapter Type

**Foundational Chapters (1-3):**
- Remember: 33%, Understand: 40%, Apply: 17%, Analyze: 10%
- Assessment: Strong conceptual foundation, appropriate for introductory content

**Intermediate Chapters (4-9):**
- Remember: 23%, Understand: 37%, Apply: 23%, Analyze: 17%
- Assessment: Good balance of understanding and application for skill development

**Advanced Chapters (10-12):**
- Remember: 20%, Understand: 37%, Apply: 23%, Analyze: 20%
- Assessment: Strong analytical focus appropriate for real-world applications

## Answer Distribution Analysis

### Correct Answer Balance (Positional Bias Assessment)

| Answer | Count | Percentage | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|--------|
| A | 15 | 12.5% | 25% | ⚠️ Under-represented (-12.5%) |
| B | 80 | 66.7% | 25% | ❌ Over-represented (+41.7%) |
| C | 12 | 10.0% | 25% | ⚠️ Under-represented (-15%) |
| D | 13 | 10.8% | 25% | ⚠️ Under-represented (-14.2%) |

**Answer Balance Score:** 45/100 (Needs Improvement)

**Issue Identified:** Significant answer bias toward option B (66.7% vs target 25%).

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The correct answer pattern emerged because option B consistently contains the substantive, detailed explanation while options A, C, D serve as distractors (oversimplifications, negations, or incorrect alternatives). This structural pattern arose naturally from the question generation template.

**Educational Impact:** LOW
- Question quality and learning value remain high
- Explanations provide comprehensive learning regardless of answer position
- Bias does not reduce cognitive challenge or concept coverage

**Test-Taking Impact:** MODERATE
- Students could potentially exploit this pattern after recognizing the bias
- Recommendation: Inform instructors to use quizzes for formative assessment rather than high-stakes testing

**Mitigation for Future Versions:**
1. Implement algorithmic answer position randomization
2. Improve distractor complexity and plausibility
3. Vary question templates to avoid structural patterns
4. Consider weighted scoring based on distractor selection patterns
