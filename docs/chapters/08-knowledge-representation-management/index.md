# Knowledge Representation and Management

## Summary

This chapter explores how graph databases excel at representing and managing knowledge structures including ontologies, taxonomies, and concept dependency graphs. You'll learn the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) for managing preferred and alternate labels, create controlled vocabularies and glossaries, and design curriculum graphs that model learning dependencies. The chapter covers knowledge management at multiple scales from personal knowledge graphs and note-taking systems to enterprise-wide knowledge capture and management platforms.

10. Taxonomies
11. Enterprise Knowledge
12. Department Knowledge
13. Project Knowledge
14. Personal Knowledge Graphs
15. Note-Taking Systems
16. Knowledge Capture
17. Tacit Knowledge
18. Codifiable Knowledge
19. Knowledge Management
20. Action Item Extraction
