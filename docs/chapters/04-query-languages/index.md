# Query Languages for Graph Databases

## Summary

This chapter provides comprehensive coverage of graph query languages including OpenCypher, GSQL, and the emerging GQL standard. You'll master Cypher syntax for pattern matching, learn how to construct complex graph queries with match, where, and return clauses, and explore GSQL's map-reduce pattern for distributed query processing. The chapter emphasizes both declarative and imperative query approaches, query optimization techniques, and performance considerations for production graph applications.
