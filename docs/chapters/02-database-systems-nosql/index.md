# Database Systems and NoSQL

## Summary

This chapter provides a comprehensive comparison of traditional database systems and modern NoSQL alternatives, establishing the context for understanding graph databases. You'll explore the evolution from RDBMS through OLAP and OLTP systems to the diverse NoSQL landscape including key-value stores, document databases, and wide-column stores. By understanding the CAP theorem and tradeoff analysis, you'll gain insight into why graph databases emerged as the optimal solution for relationship-heavy data.
