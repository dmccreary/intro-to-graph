# Commerce, Supply Chain, and IT Infrastructure

## Summary

This chapter demonstrates graph database applications in e-commerce, supply chain management, and IT infrastructure. You'll learn to model web storefronts with product catalogs, design recommendation engines using graph algorithms, and manage complex bill-of-materials structures for manufacturing. The chapter extends to IT asset management, network topology modeling, configuration management, and critical operational applications including impact analysis and root cause analysis for infrastructure troubleshooting.
