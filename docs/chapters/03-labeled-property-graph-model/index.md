# Labeled Property Graph Information Model

## Summary

This chapter introduces the Labeled Property Graph (LPG) information model, the foundation of modern graph databases. You'll learn how nodes, edges, properties, and labels work together to create expressive, flexible data models where relationships are first-class citizens. The chapter covers both schema-optional and schema-enforced approaches, explores index-free adjacency for performance, and introduces fundamental graph operations including traversal, pattern matching, and multi-hop queries.
