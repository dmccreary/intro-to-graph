# Advanced Topics and Distributed Systems

## Summary

This capstone chapter covers advanced graph database concepts including distributed architectures, real-time analytics, and visualization techniques. You'll explore graph partitioning and sharding strategies for horizontal scalability, understand replication and consistency models in distributed systems, and learn to design interactive graph visualizations. The chapter culminates with capstone project design guidance, helping you synthesize all course concepts into a complete end-to-end graph application that demonstrates mastery of graph database modeling, querying, performance optimization, and real-world application development.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 10 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Distributed Graph Databases
