# Performance, Metrics, and Benchmarking

## Summary

This chapter explores the performance characteristics that make graph databases excel at relationship-heavy workloads. You'll learn about index-free adjacency's constant-time neighbor access, understand key performance metrics like hop count and node degree, and master indexing strategies including vector indexes and composite indexes. The chapter covers industry-standard benchmarks like LDBC SNB and Graph 500, teaching you how to measure query latency, throughput, and scalability while comparing traversal costs against traditional join operations.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 20 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Hop Count
2. Degree of Node
3. Indegree
4. Outdegree
5. Edge-to-Node Ratio
6. Graph Indexes
7. Vector Indexes
8. Full-Text Search
9. Composite Indexes
10. Graph Metrics
11. Performance Benchmarking
12. Synthetic Benchmarks
13. Single-Node Benchmarks
14. Multi-Node Benchmarks
15. LDBC SNB Benchmark
16. Graph 500
17. Query Cost Analysis
18. Join Operations
19. Traversal Cost
20. Scalability

## Prerequisites
