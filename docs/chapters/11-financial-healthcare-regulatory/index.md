# Financial, Healthcare, and Regulatory Applications

## Summary

This chapter explores graph database applications in highly regulated industries including finance and healthcare. You'll learn to model financial transaction networks, implement fraud detection systems using community detection algorithms, and build anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance systems.
