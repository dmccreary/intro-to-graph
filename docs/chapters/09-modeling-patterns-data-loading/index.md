# Graph Modeling Patterns and Data Loading

## Summary

This chapter covers essential design patterns and anti-patterns for graph data modeling, helping you create maintainable and performant graph schemas. You'll explore subgraphs, supernodes, hyperedges, and multi-edges while learning time-based modeling patterns for temporal data and IoT events. The chapter provides comprehensive coverage of data loading strategies including ETL pipelines, CSV and JSON import techniques, and bulk versus incremental loading approaches, along with schema evolution and migration best practices.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 18 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Subgraphs
2. Supernodes
3. Anti-Patterns
4. Hyperedges
5. Multi-Edges
6. Time-Based Modeling
7. IoT Event Modeling
8. Bitemporal Models
9. Graph Quality Metrics
10. Model Validation
11. Schema Evolution
12. Data Migration
13. ETL Pipelines
14. CSV Import
15. JSON Import
16. Data Loading
17. Bulk Loading
18. Incremental Loading
