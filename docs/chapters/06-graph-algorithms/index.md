# Graph Algorithms

## Summary

This chapter covers essential graph algorithms that power modern graph analytics and machine learning applications. You'll learn classic search algorithms like breadth-first and depth-first search, explore pathfinding techniques including A-star and the traveling salesman problem, and master centrality measures that identify important nodes in networks. The chapter progresses to advanced topics including PageRank, community detection, graph neural networks, and graph embeddings that enable machine learning on graph-structured data.
