# Sample Prompt to Create a Graph Tutorial Layout Standard

!!! prompt
    Please use the microsim-generator skill to create a new microsim based on the p5.js library.
    The MicroSim will be created at @docs/sims/graph-tutorial-layout
    The title is "Graph Tutorial Layout"
    This microsim will draw all the regions of a graph algorithm tutorial layout.
    The template for this drawing is here: https://github.com/dmccreary/microsims/tree/main/docs/sims/microsim-layout - use the same layout with a drawing region above a control region
    This version will not have a bouncing ball, but a network graph in the left side of the log.
    Use the information here as the specification for the layout is here: @docs/instructors-guide/creating-a-step-by-step-graph-animation.md
