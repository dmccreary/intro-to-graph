# Knowledge Types

## Tacit Knowledge

**Definition:**
Tacit knowledge is the **internal, experiential, intuitive, and often subconscious knowledge** that people gain through direct experience, observation, and practice. It is difficult to write down, formalize, or express explicitly. Tacit knowledge often includes insights, mental models, pattern recognition, motor skills, and "know-how" gained from doing rather than reading.

Tacit knowledge is **personal**, **context-dependent**, and **hard to transfer** except through mentoring, apprenticeship, demonstration, or immersion.

**Characteristics:**

-   Hard to articulate

-   Learned experientially

-   Stored in mental models

-   Influenced by intuition

-   Shared through demonstration ("watch me do it")

-   Cannot be fully captured in text or rules

**Examples:**

-   Knowing how to ride a bicycle

-   An engineer's intuition about where a system will fail

-   A doctor recognizing subtle diagnostic cues in a patient

-   A teacher sensing when a student is confused

-   A chef adjusting seasoning "by feel"

## Codifiable (Codified) Knowledge


**Definition:**
Codifiable knowledge (also called **explicit knowledge**) is knowledge that can be **written down, structured, formalized, stored, indexed, and transmitted** using language, symbols, diagrams, or algorithms. It can be represented digitally or in print and is suitable for search, retrieval, and encoding into knowledge graphs.

Codifiable knowledge is **systematic**, **transferable**, and **independent of the person who originally discovered it**.

**Characteristics:**

-   Easy to articulate

-   Can be stored in documents, code, formulas, or graphs

-   Transferable at scale

-   Can be indexed and searched

-   Basis of textbooks, training materials, and rules engines

**Examples:**

-   Mathematical formulas

-   SQL or GSQL queries

-   Step-by-step procedural instructions

-   Engineering design rules

-   Scientific facts

-   Curriculum standards

-   Concept dependency graphs

-   Documentation and APIs

**Relationship to Learning Graphs and AI-Enhanced Textbooks**
=============================================================

These two knowledge types align beautifully with your **Learning Graph** framework:

### **Tacit Knowledge**

-   Appears as *cognitive strategies*

-   Represented indirectly in **skills**, **heuristics**, **hints**, or **coaching tips**

-   Transferred through **MicroSims**, demonstrations, feedback loops, or expert modeling

### **Codifiable Knowledge**

-   Appears directly as **concept nodes**, **definitions**, **procedures**, and **rules**

-   Easily structured into **LPG databases**, **curriculum graphs**, and **AI-searchable knowledge stores**

-   Forms the core of **intelligent textbooks**

**Why This Matters for Your Work**
==================================

Your textbooks and MicroSims can explicitly separate:

-   **Codifiable knowledge:** the teachable content (facts, models, diagrams, rules).

-   **Tacit knowledge:** the experiential "feel" of mastery, supported through

    -   simulations

    -   decision-making scenarios

    -   guided practice

    -   reflective prompts

    -   worked examples

This division supports your design principle that **graph-encoded knowledge handles the explicit layer, while simulations and interactive examples provide the bridge to tacit mastery**.
